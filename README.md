# Crankshaft-Piston-Engine-Simulation

Modeled a detailed internal combustion engine assembly in SolidWorks, including precision components like the crankshaft, pistons, and engine rings.

Designed individual parts with engineering accuracy, focusing on tolerancing, fit, and real-world motion feasibility.

Simulated dynamic crankshaft-piston motion using SolidWorks Motion Study, demonstrating correct timing and mechanical synchronization.

Implemented part-mating constraints and assembly hierarchy to ensure functional kinematic behavior.

Exported and rendered a high-fidelity animation of the engine cycle to visualize piston reciprocation and crankshaft rotation.

Gained hands-on experience in mechanical design principles, kinematic mechanisms, and CAD animation pipelines.
